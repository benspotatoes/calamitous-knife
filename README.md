# Namegen

I love the names that [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com)
generate for applications and repositories, so I went ahead and wrote one of my own.
I used a list of ["exquisite"](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/100-exquisite-adjectives)
adjectives and some custom ones as well to pair with a custom list of nouns.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'namegen'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install namegen

## Usage

After installing the gem, just type ```namegen``` from your command line and an
adjective-noun pair will be printed out. A verbose option ```namegen -v``` can
be specified to include a definition of the adjective (in case some of the words
are a little too "exquisite" for you like they were for me).
